# This file provides various default values for dconf paths/keys, which are to
# be shipped in the EOS OSTree. Users can override the values in the dconf
# database in their home directory — this file just provides the defaults. It is
# compiled and installed as /usr/share/eos-default-settings/settings.
#
# This is used in addition to the GSettings schema overrides in
# com.endlessm.settings.gschema.override. GSettings schema overrides do not work
# for schemas which are instantiated at multiple paths.
